# Environmental-Sound-Monitor

# Problem statement 

Our group will use Arduino to collect microphone data to send to send to MATLAB, and light up LEDs to represent the sound level.

1. Build the hardware.
2. Connect the hardware to Arduino.
3. Read the Arduino code in MATLAB.
4. Convert:
          - Volt to decibel by using a calibrate regression.
5. Record the data, and produce  plots of microphone reading vs time and voltage vs decibel level.
